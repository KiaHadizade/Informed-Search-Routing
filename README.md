# Informed Search Routing

Implementation of A* and IDA* informed search algorithms for optimal pathfinding in weighted graph

---

## Project Overview

This project solves a routing problem in a weighted graph representing a city map. The goal is to find the least-cost path between a start node and a goal node using informed search algorithms

Implemented algorithms:

- A* Search
- IDA* Search (Iterative Deepening A*)

Graph Model:

- Nodes represent intersections
- Edges represent roads
- Edge weights represent travel cost (distance or time)

Example:

```
graph = {
    (0, 0): [((0, 1), 1), ((1, 0), 1.5)],
    (0, 1): [((0, 0), 1), ((1, 1), 1)]
}
```

## Heuristic

Euclidean Distance:

`h(n) = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`

or

Manhattan Distance:

`h(n) = |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|`

## Features

- Load graph from JSON file
- A* pathfinding
- IDA* pathfinding
- Algorithm comparison
- Visited node statistics

> [!NOTE]
> Python Supports Implicit Namespace Packages (PEP 420), Which Means A Directory Can Be Treated As A Package Even Without An `__init__.py` That's Why We Are Using `python -m folderName.fileName` To Run Test Files

> [!NOTE]
> To Disable Bytecode Generation, Run: `python -B -m folderName.fileName`
> Or Put Below Code At The Very Top Of The Script:
```
import sys
sys.dont_write_bytecode = True
```

> The Most Common Approach Is Ignoring It In Git:
```
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
```
